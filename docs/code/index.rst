====================
Code: Under the Hood
====================

Here are some rudimentary documents that attempt to explain how
OpenL2M works under the hood. We will attempt to flush this out as time
permits. Meanwhile, the source code is your best bet!

The source code (mostly) uses the Google Code Style documentation format.
We also add Python type hints in many places. (Note: work in progress!)
