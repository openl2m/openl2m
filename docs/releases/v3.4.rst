===========
Version 3.4
===========

.. note::

  v3.3 and up require Postgres version 13 or greater! (I.e. Ubuntu 20.04 will no longer work.)


**Version 3.4 adds support for IPv6, Cisco CBS devices and can produce a graphic view of all device neighbors.**

New Configuration Options
-------------------------

IPv6 related:

.. code-block:: python

  # if set to True, IPv6 addresses will be shown with UPPER case letters.
  # default is lower case.
  IPV6_USE_UPPER = False

  # if set to True, the IPv6 Link-Local address of interfaces will be shown (if known)
  # note this is link-specific, and not very useful!
  IPV6_SHOW_LINKLOCAL = False

Neighbor Graph Options:

.. code-block:: python

  # Mermaid graphs of connected devices  (neighbors) can be simple or expanded.
  # Simple shows current device interface and connected neigbor.
  # Expanded also show the remote neighbor interface, if shown.
  # default is simple, ie. False. Set to True for slightly more interesting graph.
  MM_GRAPH_EXPANDED = False
