===========
Version 3.4
===========

.. note::

  v3.3 and up require Postgres version 13 or greater! (I.e. Ubuntu 20.04 will no longer work.)


**Version 3.4 adds support for IPv6, Cisco CBS devices and can produce a graphic view of all device neighbors.**

New Configuration Options
-------------------------

IPv6 related:

.. code-block:: python

  # if set to True, IPv6 addresses will be shown with UPPER case letters.
  # default is lower case.
  IPV6_USE_UPPER = False

  # if set to True, the IPv6 Link-Local address of interfaces will be shown (if known)
  # note this is link-specific, and not very useful!
  IPV6_SHOW_LINKLOCAL = False

Neighbor Graph Options:

.. code-block:: python

  # Mermaid graphs of connected devices  (neighbors) can be simple or expanded.
  # Simple shows current device interface and connected neigbor.
  # Expanded also show the remote neighbor interface, if shown.
  # default is simple, ie. False. Set to True for slightly more interesting graph.
  MM_GRAPH_EXPANDED = False



Version 3.4.1
-------------

Release Date: TBD

* add IPv6 information for interface addresses, and neighbor devices (aka IPv6 'ND')
* add expanded graph.
* show error banner if browser-side Javascript is disabled (OpenL2M requires is for proper functionality)

Bug fixes:

* fixed duplicate interface IPv4 for SNMP devices.
* fixed white-space handling in CSV import that caused device IP address errors.

Version 3.4
-------------

Release Date: 2025-02-10

* add Cisco CBS device support (PoE not tested!)
* show graphical view of neighbor devices.
* show more descriptive error details in SNMP authentication or timeout errors.
* upgrade to FontAwese v6.7
* support reading the MAU MIB to discover (optical) transceiver types (on devices that support it).
* add (some) Juniper optical tx discovery

Bug fixes:

* fix icons showing on openl2m.readthedocs.io online documentation.
* fix potential invalid interface transceiver assignment on HPE Comware devices.
* fix minor code duplication.
* fix for an ezsnmp install problem.
